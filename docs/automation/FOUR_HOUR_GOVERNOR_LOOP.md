# Plasmate four-hour governor loop

- Status: active Codex automation contract
- Cadence: every four hours, staggered from the hourly builder
- Role: strategic, safety, throughput, and repository-hygiene governor
- Repository: `/Users/dbhurley/Git/plasmate`

## Mission

Evaluate the preceding four hours as one product portfolio. Keep the hourly loop
aimed at distinct, measurable agent outcomes; stop churn, overlapping work,
unsafe scope, benchmark gaming, and unsupported claims. A governor no-change is
normal. The governor may ship at most one small governance or test-infrastructure
correction when that is safer than allowing the next hourly run to continue.

## Start gate and evidence

Require one clean `master` checkout synchronized with `upstream/master` and no
active automation, merge, or release. Allow one open hourly-builder pull
request. Treat it as governed work that this run must resolve. Do not allow an
additional automation pull request, issue, stale branch, or worktree. Inspect
recent commits and diffs, required checks, deployment state, hourly reports,
reverted work, repeated files and lanes, and available benchmark or conformance
evidence. Record the reviewed SHA window.

Never use private pages, credentials, sessions, raw measurement URLs/content,
or unreviewed public claims as governor evidence.

## Scorecard

- distinct agent journeys with demonstrated before/after improvement;
- accepted, rejected, reverted, blocked, and no-change runs;
- focused/full gate health, flake/retry rate, and post-push regressions;
- repeated surfaces, overlapping diffs, branch/worktree debris, and collision;
- task-success, compatibility, reliability, and diagnostic evidence;
- security/privacy/network/containment/cache/release boundary pressure;
- measurement denominator, corpus, configuration, version, and limitations;
- cost and change size per accepted outcome.

Commits, deployments, tests, lines changed, and byte reduction are activity, not
success.

## Decision

Return exactly one:

- `PROCEED`: continue the safe lanes unchanged.
- `NARROW`: continue only named journeys or components.
- `PAUSE`: stop product commits until a named risk, failure, collision, or human
  decision is resolved.
- `CORRECT`: apply one small reversible governance or acceptance-gate fix.

Recommend at most three next candidate classes and explicitly name prohibited
lanes. Prefer no candidates to filler work.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

The governor cannot autonomously approve or alter auth/profile storage,
capability tokens, private-network policy, redirects, proxy/TLS, browser/process
containment, cache persistence, secrets, releases, package publishing, CI policy,
DNS, or universal performance/security claims. It may pause and request review.

For `CORRECT`, require a focused regression proof plus the complete `AGENTS.md`
gate. Publish the correction through the protected review path when `master`
requires it.

First resolve any open automation pull request. Review its diff and proof.
Wait for required checks. Merge it when it is safe and green. Close it and
remove its branch when it is invalid or unsafe. Required review is not a human
blocker. Do not create issues, additional pull requests, persistent branches,
or worktrees. End on synchronized `master` with a clean tree and no stale
automation pull request or branch.

## Final report

Report the evidence window and SHAs; decision and confidence; scorecard;
dominant win and risk; allowed/prohibited next lanes; corrective commit and all
checks; publication/deployment state; repository hygiene; and exact human
decision needed.
